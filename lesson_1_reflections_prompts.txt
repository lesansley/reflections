Reflection 1
The version control was not as interesting as the
command prompt controls. The shortcuts like cmd
ls and also editing the .bash file to insert a
file address in order to create a command line
short cut.

Reflecion 2
Version control can take you back to the last 
working version and then you can track the
changes that caused the problem.

Reflection 3
Manuall commiting has the benefit of control and
being able to apply version control at logical
points in the process. However, if you forget to
commit then you have a lot of extra work.

Reflections 4
Files in projects commonly saved on git are
related while files on Google Docs ar eindependent.

Reflections 5
Once you are in the git repository type git log
to see at the commits that have been made to the
file. When you have found the commit you are
interested in then you can use git diff to compare
two different files.

Reflection 6
By having such a robust versioning you can make
large fundamental changes to your code and be sure that
if you get something wrong you can easily go back
to a working version. You will not break anything.

Reflection 7
It would be nice to start using git to version control
the html and css files that I will be creating during
the uadcity course.

Git commands:
diff [--staged]
clone
checkout [master]
log
init
status
add
branch [-b branch_name]
