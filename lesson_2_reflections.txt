Reflection 1
When you initialise a directory git places a
file in the directory that will contain all
the changes to the files. The directory is 
then logged in git.

Reflection 2
The staging area forces you to consier the 
relationhsip between changes that are being
made.

Reflection 3
Branches are useful when you are trying 
experimental changes that you are not yet
sure you want included in the code.

Reflection 4
Drawing a branch diagram helps to visual
the flow of the project and where the
different branches leave the master. So
you can see which nodes are reachable by 
each branch. It is also a good way to identify 
orphaned branches.

Reflection 5
When two brances are merged then the changes
that are common are kept and that which was
discarded by either branch is deleted from 
the final merged document.

Reflection 6
Automatic commits run the risk of introducing
bugs and errors into the code but it is a much
more effcient process that trying to match each
change before merging.
